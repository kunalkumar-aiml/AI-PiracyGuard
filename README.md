AI-PiracyGuard is a project aimed at reducing movie and video piracy on online platforms. Many times, newly released movies get leaked within hours, and creators lose revenue. This project tries to tackle that problem using Artificial Intelligence.

The idea behind this project is to automatically detect pirated video clips, identify deepfake modifications, and analyze hidden watermarks inside original content. Instead of manually searching for leaks, this system helps automate the detection process.

What this project does
	•	Extracts key frames from videos
	•	Creates a unique digital fingerprint for each video
	•	Compares uploaded clips with original content
	•	Detects deepfake or manipulated videos
	•	Helps trace the possible source of leaks using watermark analysis

Technology Used
	•	Python
	•	OpenCV
	•	Machine Learning
	•	TensorFlow
	•	NumPy and Pandas

Why I built this

I chose this project because piracy is a real-world issue faced by OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. I wanted to work on something practical that connects AI with an industry-level problem rather than just a simple college assignment.

Current Status

This project is in the development phase. I am continuously improving different modules like video extraction, similarity detection, and deepfake analysis.

Future Plans
	•	Build a simple dashboard to visualize results
	•	Improve accuracy of video matching
	•	Add automatic alert system for pirated uploads
	•	Integrate cloud-based storage for large videos
